## Getting technical

Wherever new systems interface with existing systems and processes, a detailed understanding of business needs and contexts coupled with technical platform knowledge is crucial to achieving successful solutions. Gathering requirements and project planning are necessary, but on their own are insufficient to implement enterprise-wide investment management platforms, or satellite applications, well.

For any organisation, unforeseen or unintended dependencies between business processes can be a source of operational errors. Having a detailed understanding of business activities, technical requirements, and the tools employed to deliver solutions is a significant mitigator to operational risks. Redbox ensures solutions meet clientsâ€™ needs, without introducing unnecessary complexity.

Projects benefit greatly from analysis that draws upon specialised mathematical or statistical techniques, development using programming tools or direct experience of front-office, risk and operational roles. Redbox provides this analysis, along with a deep hand-on understanding of the Aladdin investment management platform, for all clients.
